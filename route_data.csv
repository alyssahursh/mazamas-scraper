From there, the trail climbs moderately up through a section of slick rocks and roots until finally leveling off. At this point the creek and trail turn sharply right to ascend past the back side of Mystery Hill. Continue about a mile to the upper reaches of Glacier Basin. You can pass the 4,500-ft timbered knoll at the center on either side. From Glacier Basin take the obvious center gully through the lower cliff bands. Later in the season once the snow has gone this will be a death slog up talus. At the constriction of the gully go right around the wall above. Turn left around the backside of the wall and trudge up steep snow (to 45 degrees) for a few hundred feet to the col (6,760+ ft). The col is a beautiful place to take in the views. In particular, walk north from the col 100 feet or so to get a view of Columbia Peak through the gap to the west.","Climbing Washington's Mountains by Jeff Smoot Cascade Alpine Guide: Stevens Pass to Rainy Pass by Fred Beckey",,Mt Baker / Snoqualmie Nat.

But the Tatoosh offers far more than these peaks.  Chronic and committed peak-baggers willing to get off the beaten track a bit will find a more serious challenge.  How about as many as 11 peaks in 2 days!?  On day 1, you can tag Stevens, Unicorn, Boundary, Castle and Pinnacle, and the following day try Plummer, Denman, Lane, Wahpenayo, Chutla, and Eagle.  It's possible to mix and match almost as many as you want, so you can make an outing as easy or rigorous as you like.  In late season (after about mid June, most years), most or all of the snow will be gone and it'll be a rock scramble.  If you try a more ambitious mix of peaks, be sure you are fit, comfortable on steep scree and moderate snow traverses, and ready for a day of cross country travel and moderate route finding challenges.  Spectacular vistas of Mt. Rainier await you - on a clear day, of course.  Rock shoes are not needed - ropes are for the rap from Unicorn and Castle.

Sometime during the 1960s the Hogback again shifted east to its current position and grew in size. In 1930s the gully which led from the top of the Hogback to the summit became known as the Chute. When the Hogback shifted back toward the east in the 1960s, climbers followed it and started to use a different gully to gain the summit. Although the route was different, it was still called the Chute. To distinguish between the two, the term Old Chute means the route to the west.

In typical conditions, it's usually best to traverse from the top of the Palmer rather than from lower down, to lose as little altitude as possible when you cross the White River Glacier.

While there are many routes on this peak by far the most popular, and also one of the best, is the Southeast ArÃªte. What makes this route so good is its position and views. Facing south, the whole of the Mont Blanc chain rests just over your shoulder, and on belays, it is all too easy to get ""lost"" in the maze of spires and glaciers. But the route on the Index is also on a sharp ridge, and the exposure and ""airyness"" of the climb also draw our attention. Finally the summit is a very well-defined point and the very steep rappel descent only emphasizes this. This route is of moderate difficulty, with rock climbing to about 5.7 (French 5a) at its hardest. The crux comes early, on the first pitch, but there are a few moves sprinkled here and there for fun. The climb is about 6 or 7 pitches in length, which makes it a good choice for a relatively relaxed day on the hill. Because the descent is via rappel on the north side of the peak, we need to carry our hiking shoes and extra clothing over the top in small day packs.","Mont Blanc Massif; 100 Finest Routes by Gaston Rebuffat Mont Blanc Massif: Climbs, Volume II",,tel:+33(0)4 50 53 22 75,Aiguille du Midi,Arete des Cosmiques,Europe,France,12604,D,984,,,one day,Spring-Summer,Yes,5th Class,between 35 and 50 degrees,Yes,Yes,Snow and Rock,"Cosmiques Ridge commences from the Abri Simond hut from where it climbs 150m to 3770m.
