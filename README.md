# Scraping
A scraper built to grab data from [mazamas.org](http://www.mazamas.org), rearrange it, and use the results to grab related data from [summitpost.org](http://www.summitpost.org)

## About
This scraper was built to scrape data for use in a [web application](https://github.com/alyssahursh/mazamas) for the [Mazamas](http://mazamas.org).

Using the Ruby gems HTTParty and Nokogiri, I created a small scraping scrip that (with permission from the Mazamas) spoofs authentication on mazamas.org(http://mazamas.org)
